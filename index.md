## Welcome to my github "Data Science in R" pages



### Purpose
I plan to use this page for my data science projects and most of them are developed for teaching purposes. There will be lots of references to the work of others, and hopefully people will find it useful.


### Older Projects
I keep working on several simultaneous projects:
<br>
#### COVID19
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://fdepaolis.github.io/github-site/NYT.html" title="COVID19_NYT" target="_blank">This one</a> uses The New York Times COVID19 dataset by state and county.

&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://fdepaolis.github.io/github-site/ATL.html" title="COVID19_NYT" target="_blank">This one</a> uses data from the Tracking COVID project.

#### US Trade
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://fdepaolis.github.io/github-site/US_Trade.html" title="US_Trade" target="_blank">This project</a> analyzes US trade with China and the world, esp. in manufacturing and electronics.
