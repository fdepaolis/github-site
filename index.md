## Welcome to my github Data Science pages



### Purpose
I plan to use this page for my data science projects and most of them are developed for teaching purposes. There will be lots of references to the work of others, and hopefully people will find it useful.


### Projects
I keep working on two on-going projects:
<br>The one that uses New York Times COVID19 data by state and county is <a href="https://fdp2012.github.io/FernandoDePaolis.github.io/NYT.html" title="COVID19_NYT" target="_blank">here</a>

...and the one using COVID19 data from The Tracking COVID Project is <a href="https://fdp2012.github.io/FernandoDePaolis.github.io/ATL.html" title="COVID19_ATL" target="_blank">here</a>
