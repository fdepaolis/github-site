## Welcome to my github Data Science pages



### Purpose
I plan to use this page for my data science projects and most of them are developed for teaching purposes. There will be lots of references to the work of others, and hopefully people will find it useful.


### Projects
I keep working on two on-going projects:
<br>
<br>The one that uses <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data" title="NewYorkTime github" target="_blank">New York Times COVID19 data</a> by state and county is <a href="https://fdp2012.github.io/github-site/NYT.html" title="COVID19_NYT" target="_blank">here</a>

<br>...and the one using COVID19 data from <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data" title="Tracking COVID Project" target="_blank">The Tracking COVID Project</a> is <a href="https://fdp2012.github.io/github-site/ATL.html" title="COVID19_ATL" target="_blank">here</a>
