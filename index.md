## Welcome to my github "Data Science in R" pages



### Purpose
I plan to use this page for my data science projects and most of them are developed for teaching purposes. There will be lots of references to the work of others, and hopefully people will find it useful.


### Projects
I keep working on several on-going projects:
<br>
#### COVID19 (mostly data processing, but also some time-series analysis)
&nbsp;&nbsp; The one that uses <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data" title="NewYorkTime github" target="_blank">New York Times COVID19 data</a> by state and county is <a href="https://fdepaolis.github.io/github-site/NYT.html" title="COVID19_NYT" target="_blank">here</a>

&nbsp;&nbsp; ...and the one using data from <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data" title="Tracking COVID Project" target="_blank">The Tracking COVID Project</a> is <a href="https://fdepaolis.github.io/github-site/ATL.html" title="COVID19_ATL" target="_blank">here</a>
