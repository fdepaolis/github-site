# Data Science pages
Welcome to my GitHub site


## Purpose
I plan to use this page for my data science projects. This is the begining of this page and there is not much content yet. Come back later

### Projects
First project: COVID19 using New York Times data by state and county. You can see the first version <a href="https://fdp2012.github.io/FernandoDePaolis.github.io/COVID19.html" title="COVID19">here</a>

Second project: Coming up soon another project using data from the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic
